    This repository was created with the propose of showing some of my projects to the community like a portfolio. All the content were made using strongly JavaScript      language with the aim of improving the skills whith that kind of architecture. HTML and CSS may apper in some projects, but this isn't the focus. I'm still seeking      new for learning, i.e., this repository will be constantly updated.
